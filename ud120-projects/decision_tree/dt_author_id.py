Go into ../tools/email_preprocess.py, and find the line of code that looks like this:
selector = SelectPercentile(f_classif, percentile=10)
Change percentile from 10 to 1, and rerun dt_author_id.py. Whatâ€™s the number of features now?
Also compute the accuracy when feature percentile is changed to 1 %
